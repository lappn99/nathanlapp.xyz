I am not a big fan of writing HTML, or any web technology for that matter; so my plan is to just write all the pages in `Markdown` and just convert them with `pandoc` into static webpages. Hopefully at the very least it will be a fun experiment. 

After the webpages are built and archived, they will be packaged as a release. Then on my server I can just `wget` or `curl` them and install it, all automatically! :D
