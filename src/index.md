## Hello, im Nathan Lapp

I'm a recent undergrad from Trent University.

I'm currently interested in Computer Graphics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), low-level programming, high-performance computing, and just general hacking around. 

I mostly program in C on Linux, although im always looking to challenge myself, learning new things and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, like building this website!

Check out some of my [projects](projects/projects.html)
